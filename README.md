# ‚å®Ô∏è Typing Test

This was the **very first project** I ever built. At the age of 15, I created a simple Windows app that allows users to take a typing test and then displays detailed statistics at the end.

## üíª About the Project

* Written in **C**, my first programming language.
* Uses the classic `graphics.h` library for rendering UI elements.
* `graphics.h` is a DOS-based graphics library, quite different from modern GUI frameworks like **GTK** or **Qt**.
* Using only basic primitives such as **lines**, **circles**, **rectangles**, and **text**, I manually constructed the entire UI.
* The UI was designed entirely from scratch ‚Äî no UI builders or frameworks were used, just raw code.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility Note

Most of the technology used (especially `graphics.h`) is now deprecated, and compiling the code on modern systems is difficult without legacy tools or DOS emulators.
However, the **original executable still runs on modern Windows**, although some antivirus software may flag it as suspicious due to its vintage nature.

## üöÄ Try It Out

Feel free to download the executable and give it a try!
