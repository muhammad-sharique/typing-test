# typing-test

This was the very first project I ever built. At the age of 15, I created this simple Windows app that lets users take a typing test and then shows detailed statistics at the end.

I learnt C as my first programming language and used the `graphics.h` library for all the graphical elements in the app. `graphics.h` is a DOS-based library, quite different from the modern GUI libraries like GTK or Qt, which are popular today. It allows basic rendering of text and simple shapes like circles, lines, and rectangles. Using just these primitives, I designed the entire UI from scratch â€” essentially rendering every visible pixel on the screen manually through code.

Most of the technology used is now deprecated, so the code is quite difficult to compile again. However, the original executable still works!

Feel free to download it and give it a try.
Thanks!
